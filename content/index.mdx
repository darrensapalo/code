Hi. My name is Darren. I like teaching (about coding, thinking, life) a lot, 
and I want to practice being more open about the things that I use that helps
me do excellent coding, thinking, and living.

This site is dedicated to my coding toolset, so if you would like to use what
I use, feel free to pick these up and explore them.

You can begin exploring the [tools](/tools) if you like.
