title: "Darren's coding"
---

Hi there. I'm Darren, a software architect and full stack software developer.

This is where I write about technologies and concepts that I keep in my 
problem-solving belt.  You will see the things I've been learning, and how 
I practice my reading and my writing. 

You can get started by reading about [general concepts](./concepts).

You can follow that up with reading [pragmatic, best practices](./best-practices) I've been using.

If you enjoy applying your thinking and knowledge for practical use even 
outside of software development, then you would enjoy browsing through 
[strategies](./strategies) or my personal blog's 
[mental models list](https://sapalo.dev/category/mental-models/).

**What is this website exactly?**

You can think of this website as a public notebook, a place where I write
down the map of my ideas and current understanding of things. This means that these
are draft ideas; very rough. They may not be exact but they have been serving a purpose.
Those that remain stand the test of experiments, and those ideas that are thrown away 
become valuable stories with a lesson to be learned. 

A friendly reminder that [even the best maps are imperfect](https://fs.blog/2015/11/map-and-territory/).
But nonetheless, you are free to see what my map looks like. Feel free to read, reflect,
personalize, and contextualize it for yourself. Pick up and play with anything up you like.

Unfortunately, this website is **specifically designed as a learning portal** 
where I write about what I've learned (and continue to learn). If that's what you're
looking for, then great!
