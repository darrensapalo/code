# VS Code

I really like VSCode and how customizable it is.

## `tasks.json`

I like having a `.vscode/` folder in my project's root directory, so that I can configure a `tasks.json` 
and simply run tasks from VS Code's Command Palette. This lets me share my configurations and work more
effectively with my teammates.
