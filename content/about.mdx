title: "About me"
---

I'm Darren. As of the date of this writing, I am currently a lead architect and
full stack software developer for [Talino Venture Labs](https://talinolabs.com/).

Professionally, I do tech consulting for software development agencies, start ups.
I teach software development to interested learners and I enjoy watching
my peers grow to become more and more skilled individuals- both professionally and personally.

Life is a lot more than just work; and there are great personal development milestones
that enable people to immensely transform and uplift their personal lives. I enjoy 
mentoring dedicated students, observing and supporting their wrestle against challenges,
and being a fellow merry-maker in their victories.

I am student of inclusivity and empathy; Thankfully, work opportunities line me up
into financial inclusion and education.
